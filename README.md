WP starting pack
============

This script offer a modern workflow to manage Wordpress installation and setup very seamsly. Through a user prompt in the command line you can:

* Install the latest version of Wordpress with Composer.
* Setup WP core in a custom directory (site up and running in http://localhost/yoursite).
* Move wp-config.php from WP core  directory (https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/58391/is-moving-wp-config-outside-the-web-root-really-beneficial).
* Create DB in your local system (if it doesn't exist).
* Custom wp-content directory, outside WP folder (the script does the needed modifications to wp-config.php file).
* Installation and activation of your prefered plugins (a set of common plugins are predefined).
* WP-SYNC plugin installation, to manage your DB through differents enviroments.


To do:
* Configure multi-enviroment through the setup.
* Generate salt keys in wp-config files.
* Custom underscore Wordpress theme.
* WP core as a GIT submodule.
* Random generate WP admin username and password.

In 5 minutes, you will have a fresh Wordpress installation, with a lot of security and performance tweaks, plugins and more.

## Whats the magic?

It manages Wordpress installation with Composer. Set up is done with WP-CLI and BASH scripting.

WP starting pack is an internal project of <a href='atiasweb.com'>Atiasweb</a>a> web design and developent company. It hasn't been developed from scratch, but by putting together many techinques and methods.

We want to make of it a maintainable and stable alternative for launching fresh and highly top-notch WP install. 

Furthermore, we have GIT and Continous Integration in mind, so whoever in the team can build up and recreate the project in any devolopment enviroment.

## System requeriments:

Before getting started, make sure you have installed, up and running:

- PHP 5.3.2+
- Composer: https://getcomposer.org/.
- WP CLI: https://wp-cli.org/
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

It has been tested on Mac. I realise that it should work on Linux systems as well.

## Getting started

__1. In terminal, go to the project folder and type (as root, or using sudo):__

```bash
# composer install;
# chmod +x wpconfigure.sh
# ./wpconfigure.sh
```

## Reported issues

* "env: mysql: No such file or directory" error: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44440064/env-mysql-no-such-file-or-directory-after-wp-import#44856936

* MAMP or local server not running (yeah, this happens).

* Error: Error establishing a database connection. This either means that the username and password information in your `wp-config.php` file is incorrect or we canâ€™t contact the database server at `localhost`: https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#using-a-custom-php-binary and https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/2662
